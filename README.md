## Introduction

The objective of this report is to provide bank management with reliable information extracted, processed, and analyzed from telephone survey data. This will enable them to make well-informed decisions aimed at maximizing the bank's profits and revenues while maintaining its position as one of the leading banks in the region.

## Problem Statement

Between May 2019 and November 2020, a bank in Portugal conducted a telephone marketing campaign to promote a new certificate of deposit with special benefits. The objective of this campaign was to increase the adoption of this financial product among clients. However, after the campaign ended, there is a need to evaluate its effectiveness to determine whether it achieved its objectives and identify the client characteristics that influenced product adoption.

Using the data collected during the campaign, the following key questions need to be addressed:

* 1) What was the adoption rate of the new certificate of deposit during the campaign?
* 2) Which client characteristics are associated with a higher likelihood of adopting the product?
* 3) Is there a statistically significant relationship between clients’ age and the likelihood of adopting the certificate of deposit?
 
## Simple Random Sampling

Simple Random Sampling refers to a sample selection technique where every element in the population has an equal probability of being selected. This ensures that the sample is representative and unbiased, allowing for accurate inferences about the broader population. (Sampieri, 2014)

## Steps by steps using Excel

* 1. A unique code is assigned to each participant's response, labeled as the variable "ID".

* 2. We use the sampling function to obtain 1,000 sample observations (survey responses – individuals).

 * 3. We use the filter function to extract data from the other variables. The searchv function could also work, but it would be more complex.

## Usage of Excel

Excel is a widely used tool in data analysis due to its versatility, ease of use, and accessibility. It allows users to organize, clean, and analyze data efficiently through features like sorting, filtering, formulas, and pivot tables. Excel is also equipped with tools for creating charts and graphs, making it a go-to option for quick visualizations. Its compatibility with various file formats and integration with other software further enhances its utility. While it has limitations with large datasets and advanced analytics, Excel remains a foundational tool in data analysis and is commonly used across industries for reporting and decision-making.
