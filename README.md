## Introduction

The objective of this report is to provide bank management with reliable information extracted, processed, and analyzed from telephone survey data. This will enable them to make well-informed decisions aimed at maximizing the bank's profits and revenues while maintaining its position as one of the leading banks in the region.

## Problem Statement

Between May 2019 and November 2020, a bank in Portugal conducted a telephone marketing campaign to promote a new certificate of deposit with special benefits. The objective of this campaign was to increase the adoption of this financial product among clients. However, after the campaign ended, there is a need to evaluate its effectiveness to determine whether it achieved its objectives and identify the client characteristics that influenced product adoption.

Using the data collected during the campaign, the following key questions need to be addressed:

* 1) What was the adoption rate of the new certificate of deposit during the campaign?
* 2) Which client characteristics are associated with a higher likelihood of adopting the product?
* 3) Is there a statistically significant relationship between clientsâ€™ age and the likelihood of adopting the certificate of deposit?
